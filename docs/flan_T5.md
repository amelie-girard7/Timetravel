# FLAN-T5

## Introduction

FLAN-T5 represents a significant advancement in the realm of language models, as introduced in the research paper titled "Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models." This model is a variant of the original T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) that has undergone additional finetuning across a diverse set of tasks, enhancing its versatility and effectiveness.

FLAN-T5 is designed for ease of use, allowing for the utilization of its pre-trained weights without the necessity for additional finetuning. This feature simplifies the process of integrating FLAN-T5 into various applications. Below is a basic example demonstrating how to employ FLAN-T5 for generating text:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")

inputs = tokenizer("A step by step recipe to make bolognese pasta:", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True))
# Output: ['Pour a cup of bolognese into a large bowl and add the pasta']
```

## Enhancements in FLAN-T5

FLAN-T5 incorporates all the improvements found in T5 version 1.1, which include optimizations for efficiency and model performance. For a comprehensive understanding of these improvements, one should refer to the detailed documentation provided for T5 version 1.1.
