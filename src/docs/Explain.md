Our task involves rewriting stories by introducing a "counterfactual event" that changes the narrative sequence. This is akin to conducting causal interventions as defined by Judea Pearl. The inclusion of such an event requires that narrative alterations adhere to a universally recognized logic of how events typically unfold in reality. Counterfactual rewriting goes beyond simple narrative changes; it involves a deep comprehension and reconstruction of the complex interplay of causes and effects within the storyline. This task demands thorough and varied narrative adjustments to ensure the newly guided storyline authentically corresponds with the introduced counterfactual element. The challenge lies in making these narrative changes not only plausible but also coherently aligned with the original story's premise, showcasing a profound and nuanced grasp of the narrative's causal framework.

Dataset Structure:
- **Premise**: "Andrea wanted a picture of her jumping."
- **Initial**: "She set the camera up."
- **Counterfactual**: "She asked her friend to draw one."
- **Original Ending**: "Then, she jumped in the air. The picture kept coming out wrong. It took twenty tries to get it right."
- **Edited Ending**: "Then, she jumped in the air to demonstrate how she wanted it to look. The picture kept coming out wrong.It took drawing it several times to get it right."

#### Example

```json
{
  "story_id": "4fd7d150-b080-4fb1-a592-8c27fa6e1fc8",
  "premise": "Andrea wanted a picture of her jumping.",
  "initial": "She set the camera up.",
  "counterfactual": "She asked her friend to draw one.",
  "original_ending": "Then, she jumped in the air. The picture kept coming out wrong. It took twenty tries to get it right.",
  "edited_ending": "Then, she jumped in the air to demonstrate how she wanted it to look. The picture kept coming out wrong.It took drawing it several times to get it right."
}
```

For better understanding of how narrative adjustments are made, we employ attention visualization techniques. These allow us to observe which parts of the story the model emphasizes during the generation of the edited ending. 

### Attention Visualization for Explainability

Attention visualization is a powerful technique used to enhance the transparency of machine learning models, especially in natural language processing tasks like our story rewriting project. This method reveals which parts of the input data the model pays most attention to when generating the output. By visualizing the attention weights, we gain insights into the decision-making process of the model, helping us understand how and why certain narrative changes are made in response to a counterfactual event.

#### How Attention Visualization Works

In our story rewriting task, attention visualization can be used to pinpoint the areas within the text where the model focuses its attention while generating the edited ending of a story. This is particularly useful for ensuring that the counterfactual changes are logically and coherently integrated into the story's narrative.

Let's take the example from our dataset to illustrate how attention visualization would work:

- **Premise**: "Andrea wanted a picture of her jumping."
- **Initial**: "She set the camera up."
- **Counterfactual**: "She asked her friend to draw one."
- **Original Ending**: "Then, she jumped in the air. The picture kept coming out wrong. It took twenty tries to get it right."
- **Edited Ending**: " Then, she jumped in the air to demonstrate how she wanted it to look. The picture kept coming out wrong.It took drawing it several times to get it right."

In the above example, the counterfactual event is "She asked her friend to draw one." The model's task is to rewrite the original ending considering this new information. Using attention visualization, we could observe the following:

1. **High Attention on "She asked her friend to draw one"**: This indicates the model recognizes the change from a photograph to a drawing, which impacts the subsequent actions in the narrative.
2. **Moderate Attention on "Then, she jumped in the air"**: The model may focus on this part of the original text to decide how Andreaâ€™s jump would be described differently given that it is now being drawn rather than photographed.
3. **Attention Shifts in the Edited Ending**: By analyzing the attention distribution across "Then, she jumped in the air to demonstrate how she wanted it to look," we might find increased focus on "demonstrate," reflecting the need to illustrate the jump to the friend, which is a new narrative direction due to the counterfactual event.

The attention maps generated during this process would visually represent the focus intensity across different segments of the text. This not only aids in understanding the model's decision-making process but also helps in evaluating the plausibility and coherence of the narrative adjustments relative to the counterfactual input. This method serves as a bridge between the opaque computations within the model and the human understanding necessary for refining and trusting AI-generated content.
